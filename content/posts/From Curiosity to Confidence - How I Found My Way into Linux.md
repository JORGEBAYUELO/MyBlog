## Introduction:
When people ask me how I got into Linux, I usually smile, because it wasn’t out of ambition or some deep technical calling. It all started with a really **slow computer**.

I was around 13 or 14 when a friend, already dabbling in systems engineering, told me _“Hey, why not try Linux?”_ At the time, Windows ran like molasses on my old hardware. My friend was right, Linux might just be the fix I needed. So I gave it a shot and installed Ubuntu, having no clue that I had just cracked open the door to a whole new world.
## The Shift: From Tinkerer to DevOps Explorer
Years later, as I began transitioning into **DevOps**, Linux came back, not just as an option, but as a requirement. You can’t dive deep into DevOps without bumping into Linux constantly. It’s everywhere: servers, containers, cloud platforms, you name it. I knew that running it inside a virtual machine wouldn’t cut it anymore. I wanted the **real experience**.

That’s when I made a decision: I’d install Linux natively through **dual boot**, using a dedicated **NVMe SSD** just for it. I did my research, learned how messy it could get running two OSes on a single drive, and decided to go with the cleanest setup possible.
## Distro Discovery: Finding My Flavor
My first Linux distro? **Ubuntu**, of course, the go-to recommendation for beginners. But once I started digging deeper, I was shocked by the sheer number of options. Man, there are _a lot_ of distros out there.

I tried **CentOS** and **RHEL** during my RHCSA studies, both solid, enterprise-grade systems. But I wanted something more bleeding-edge without losing professionalism. Enter: **Fedora**.

Fedora gave me the best of both worlds, a modern, frequently updated system with access to the **`dnf` package manager**, which aligned perfectly with my RHCSA prep and my long-term DevOps goals.
## Breaking, Fixing, Learning
Of course, it wasn’t all smooth sailing. My first battles were with **Bluetooth connectivity**, and later came the monster: **Hyprland**.

Hyprland opened the door to the world of ultra-customized Linux setups and also the need to learn `.conf`, `.yaml`, and `.toml` files. I broke my system more than once trying to get it right. One time I even had to reinstall everything from scratch. But I didn’t mind, it was part of the learning curve, and I genuinely enjoyed the process.

Thanks to my comfort with the terminal, I adapted quickly. I was already used to working in CLI environments before switching to Linux full-time. In fact, I’ll always take the terminal over a GUI for things like installing or updating software, it just feels faster, cleaner, and more powerful.
## Linux Today: My Main Operating System
These days, **Linux is my daily driver**. I do everything on it, coding, DevOps projects, system automation, shell scripting. The only times I switch to Windows are for **design work** (due to software limitations) or **gaming** (let’s be honest: Linux gaming has come a long way, but Windows still wins that battle… for now).

As for tools and commands I use the basics all the time: `cd`, `ls -ltr`, `grep`, `find`, and so on. My favorite terminal tool right now is **Ghostty**. It’s fast, clean, and super customizable, a must-have for someone like me who spends most of the day in the terminal.

One of my recent milestones was building a full [**CI/CD pipeline using Docker on Linux**](https://github.com/JORGEBAYUELO/CappuccinoCupApp), all natively. That’s when it really hit me how powerful and stable Linux can be once you know your way around.
## Looking Back (and Forward)
If I could give one piece of advice to my younger self?  
**Stick with it.** You’ll need it later, especially in DevOps. Learning Linux is like having superpowers at your fingertips.

And for anyone just starting out?  
Know **why** you’re learning Linux. The distro you choose, the tools you learn, even the package manager you use, they all depend on your focus. I wanted something professional, modern, and compatible with `dnf` because I’m studying for the RHCSA and building a DevOps career. Your path might be different and that’s totally okay.

**In the end**, Linux isn’t just an operating system. It’s a mindset, one that rewards curiosity, persistence, and a willingness to learn by breaking things. And I wouldn’t have it any other way.
