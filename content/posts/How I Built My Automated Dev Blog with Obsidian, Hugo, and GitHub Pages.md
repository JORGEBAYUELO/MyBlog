## Introduction:
I’ve always wanted a place where I could document my journey into tech, especially as I transition from being a technical artist to a DevOps engineer. But I didn’t just want _any_ blog. I wanted something **clean**, **fast**, and most importantly, **automated**. That way, I could focus on writing, not fiddling with deployment.

So I decided to build my blog using a stack that aligned with the tools I love:  
📝 Obsidian for writing,  
⚙️ Hugo for static site generation, and  
🚀 GitHub Pages for free and automated deployment.

This is the story of how I put it all together, and how it’s already changed the way I share what I learn.
