## Introduction:
Building real world projects is one of the best ways to learn, and that’s exactly what I wanted to do with this one. This project was my way of testing everything I’ve been learning about **DevOps, AWS, and Infrastructure as Code** in a practical and hands-on way.

So, what’s the project about?  
I created a **fully automated cloud infrastructure on AWS using Terraform**, where I deployed a web server (Nginx) inside an EC2 instance. The infrastructure is managed entirely through code and includes everything from networking and security group configuration to remote state management using S3 and DynamoDB.

## Why I Built It:
As someone who is **self-taught** and **switching careers into DevOps**, I’ve been putting a lot of time into learning tools like Terraform. But reading docs and watching videos only go so far. I needed to _build_ something real to solidify the concepts and test myself.
This project helped me:
- Practice writing and organizing Terraform code.
- Understand AWS services and how they work together.
- Improve my ability to troubleshoot real-world issues.
